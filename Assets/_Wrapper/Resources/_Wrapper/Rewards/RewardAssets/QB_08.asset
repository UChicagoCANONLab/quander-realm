  title: 'Measurement '
  backText: "-Making measurements on a qubit affects the qubit's state\n-Even small
    disturbances, like vibrations, can \"measure\" a qubit accidentally \n-A qubit
    that starts out as a superposition of 0 and 1 has only one of those values after
    being measured--Goodbye superposition\n "
  flavorText: How does a zombie measure the length of something? With feet, or any
    body part that's lying around.
