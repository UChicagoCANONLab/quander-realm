  title: Vacuum Chamber
  backText: '-Atom qubits need to be isolated from other atoms and molecules to stay
    intact. A vacuum chamber does the trick.

    -Vacuum chambers are made of glass
    and stainless steel.

    -Pumps remove everything from the chamber, even the
    air. Perfect for the loner atom qubits.'
  flavorText: Not as useful for cleaning up cat fur
