  title: Quantum Circuit
  backText: '-It''s a program that runs on a quantum computer

    -A quantum circuit
    contains gates

    -Order matters! The gates need to be in a particular order
    so that the circuit does what you want

    -A quantum circuit takes quantum
    bits (qubits) as inputs and measure them at output'
