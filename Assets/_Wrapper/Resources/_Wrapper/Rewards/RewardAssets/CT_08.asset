  title: Gate Simplification
  backText: '-There are different ways to make a circuit do the same thing to qubits

    -Doing
    things with the least amount of gates is what we call the simplest circuit

    -Simplifying
    circuits is similar to simplifying math equations

    -For example, 2+(1+4-4)
    can be simplified to 2+1 '
  flavorText: 'Gate simplification is as easy as 7-(2*3), 2+4-4, 3*(4-3) '
